# Style Transfer

The idea is to create an image with the style of some other image, essentially transfering the style of a style image to the base or content image. This project uses python 3, and heavily uses packages like tensorflow and keras. 
Jupyter notebook was also used, but in principle is not needed.



### Necessary Python Libraries/Packages

PIL - A Library in python that allows image processing to be handled much more easily. Pillow is an updated alternative and should work in place of PIL.

Matplotlib - This is a plotting library, and is standard for python. It is normally already installed when python is downloaded.

Random - This is the labrary that allows random numbers to be handled. It is normally already installed when python is downloaded.

Numpy - This is the library that handles arrays. It is normally already installed when python is downloaded.

Tensorflow - This is the library that is most widely used by machine learning engineer in python. It handles image classification, and has most well known deep learning algorithms and functions built it. It may not already be downloaded even if python 3 has already been installed.



### Installation

To install any library, just use the pip install function, for example:
$ pip install Pillow

This will work for windows, mac and linux. For othe libraries, replace 'Pillow' with the name of the other library to be download.
